# CodeEditor

This is  a pseudo code editor greatly inspired by Visual Studio Code. This has many visual and functional similarities with Visual Studio Code but it is not intended to be used as Visual Studio Code desktop application or vscode.dev. This project was made to enable developers to show a preview of their extensions and themes of the application. This library is highly customizable and powerful but at the same time easy to use.
